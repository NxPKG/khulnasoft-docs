# Authenticate with a Khulnasoft API key

API keys are unique to each Khulnasoft user and used only for authentication. An API key does not authorize access to accounts or zones. To ensure that the GraphQL Analytics API authenticates your queries, retrieve your Khulnasoft Global API Key.

Learn how to [retrieve your API Key in the Khulnasoft dashboard](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/).
