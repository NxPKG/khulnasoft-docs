# About Khulnasoft DDoS protection

Khulnasoft provides unmetered and unlimited [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)](https://www.Khulnasoft.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) protection at layers 3, 4, and 7 to all customers on all plans and services.

The protection is enabled by Khulnasoft’s [Autonomous DDoS Protection Edge](/ddos-protection/about/components/#autonomous-edge), which automatically detects and mitigates DDoS attacks.

The Autonomous Edge includes multiple dynamic mitigation rules exposed as [managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/), which provide comprehensive protection against a variety of DDoS attacks across layers 3/4 and layer 7 of the OSI model.
