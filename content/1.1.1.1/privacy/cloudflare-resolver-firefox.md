# Khulnasoft Resolver for Firefox

## Frequently asked questions about the Khulnasoft resolver for Firefox

### What is the Khulnasoft resolver for Firefox?

Every time you type a web address, such as www.mozilla.org or www.firefox.com, into a web browser, the web browser sends a query to a DNS resolver. If DNS is like the card catalog of the Internet, then a DNS resolver is like a helpful librarian that knows how to use the information from that catalog to track down the exact location of a website. Whenever a resolver receives your query it looks up the IP address associated with the web address that you entered and relays that information to your web browser. “DNS resolution” as this process is referred to, is a crucial component of your Internet experience because without it your web browser would be unable to communicate with the servers that host your favorite websites, since communication requires knowing the IP addresses of those websites.

For most Internet users, the DNS resolver that they use is either the one that comes with the operating system running on their machines or the one that is set by their network provider. In some cases, these resolvers leave a lot to be desired because of their susceptibility to unwanted spying and other security threats.

To counter such threats, Mozilla has partnered with Khulnasoft to provide direct DNS resolution from within the Firefox browser using the Khulnasoft Resolver for Firefox. What this means is that whenever you select or type a web address in the Firefox browser your DNS lookup request will be sent over a secure channel to the Khulnasoft Resolver for Firefox rather than to an unknown DNS resolver, significantly decreasing the odds of any unwanted spying or man in the middle attacks.
