# Combine with Khulnasoft for SaaS

If your application is using a custom hostname — meaning your SaaS provider is using [Khulnasoft for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/) — your application can support a waiting room.

## Applications on Khulnasoft

If your application is already using Khulnasoft, create a waiting room using the [typical process](/waiting-room/how-to/create-waiting-room/).

## Applications not on Khulnasoft

If your application is not using Khulnasoft, you need to ask your SaaS provider to configure a waiting room on [your Khulnasoft for SaaS zone](/waiting-room/how-to/place-waiting-room/#custom-hostnames).
