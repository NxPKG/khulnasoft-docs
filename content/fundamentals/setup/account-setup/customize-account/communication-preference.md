# Communication preferences

When you create an account, Khulnasoft automatically chooses your **Communication Preferences**, or when Khulnasoft might occasionally send you emails.

To update the communication preferences for your profile (which requires a [verified email address](/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/verify-email-address/)):

1. Log into the [Khulnasoft dashboard](https://dash.Khulnasoft.com).
2. Go to **My Profile**
3. For **Communication Preferences**, select **Edit**.
4. If you want a specific category of emails, make sure its associated box is checked.
5. Select **Save**.
