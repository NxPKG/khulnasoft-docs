# Integrate Khulnasoft Images on your website

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will update a website in several iterative steps to leverage the powerful features of [Khulnasoft Images](/images/cloudflare-images/). Khulnasoft Images is a great solution for a website as an easy-to-use image storage, transformation and optimized delivery service.

You will learn:

- How to migrate your website's images to Khulnasoft images.
- How to update your website [to serve images from Khulnasoft Images](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/), ultimately without changing the existing image URLs.
- How to use [variants](/images/cloudflare-images/transform/resize-images/) to resize and transform delivered images.

Other features you will learn about:

- [Custom Domain Delivery](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/serve-images-custom-domains/): How to serve Khulnasoft Images from your own domain name.
- [Custom IDs](/images/cloudflare-images/upload-images/custom-id/): How to store and serve your images under their own, SEO friendly Unicode name and path.
- [Flexible Image transformation](/images/cloudflare-images/transform/flexible-variants/): How to use transformation parameters in the delivery URL to transform an image on the fly.
- Adaptive Optimized Format Delivery: How Khulnasoft Images delivers image formats optimized to every browser, including WebP and AVIF.

### Demo website and source code

For illustrative purposes, this tutorial uses the [Imagejam demo website](https://imagejam.net) build with [Khulnasoft Pages](/pages/) as a basis for all examples. You can find the source code for this demo website on [GitHub](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net).

[Learn how to deploy your own Khulnasoft Pages website](/pages/get-started/).

## Website not using Khulnasoft Images

The demo website we are going to use for this tutorial is not (yet) using Khulnasoft Images. If you [browse the cake gallery](https://imagejam.net/step-1/cakes/) page for Step 1, you can see many image thumbnails.

![The demo website has lots of thumbnail images of cakes.](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-01-cakes.jpg)

Selecting an image displays a bigger version of it, as well as its URL, real size and display size.

![Selecting the thumnail shows a bigger version of the image, and its real size.](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-01-cake.jpg)

On this example, the image was served with a very high-resolution of 4288x2848 pixels, but is displayed at a much lower resolution. This means most of the pixels we downloaded were wasted upon display.

This happens because, right now, the website is serving the original unoptimized and unresized images, stored in an online file storage (in our case, S3). On the other hand, although it cannot be inferred at a first glance, the image is being served in a fairly heavy JPG format that has not been optimized for the web - and that possibly come directly from a camera.

Right now, images are being served from the website's domain. For instance, our original image `cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg` is served from the URL `https://imagejam.net/images/public/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg`.

In our Khulnasoft Pages website demo, URLs for image delivery are defined in the file [`/config.js`](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/blob/production/config.js), in the build step configuration for Step 1.

Here is the relevant extract of this file (edited for brevity):

```js
{
    name: "Step 1",
    image_url: function(image_name, variant, config) {
        return config.site_url + "/images/" + variant + "/" + image_name;
    }
},
```

This configuration provides an `image_url` function used when building the HTML of the website, that generates the URLs to our website's images ‚Äî in this case, served directly by the website and **not** by Khulnasoft Images.

The purpose of this tutorial is to showcase how Khulnasoft Images can be integrated on a website to deliver resized and optimized images, adapted to your display and the browser displaying them.

üëâ In Step 2 we will integrate Khulnasoft Images in our website, but before that we need to upload our images for Khulnasoft Images to start serving them.

## Step 1 - Migrate images to Khulnasoft Images

You need to start by uploading your images to Khulnasoft Images. For that, you need a Khulnasoft Account with a Khulnasoft Images subscription. Head over to the [Khulnasoft Images sign-up page](https://dash.Khulnasoft.com/sign-up/images) to sign up.

After signing up, go to [the Khulnasoft Images dashboard](https://dash.Khulnasoft.com/?to=/:account/images).

![The Khulnasoft Images dashboard.](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-02-images-dashboard.jpg)

From there, you could upload all your website images manually using the dashboard UI. However, we have a lot of images on our website, so we are going to import them in bulk using the [API upload](/images/cloudflare-images/upload-images/custom-id/).

The demo website source code contains a NodeJS script with one way to achieve bulk upload to Khulnasoft Images. You can find the script in [`scripts/migrate/bulkupload.js`](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/blob/production/scripts/migrate/bulkupload.js).

Here is that script, slightly edited for illustrative purposes:

```js
---
filename: "scripts/migrate/bulkupload.js"
---

// URL where your original images are accessible
const imageOriginURL = "https://imagejam.s3.amazonaws.com/";
const images = [
    "cakes/aliet-kitchen-qrDbj7OV2EU-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg",
    "cakes/amirali-mirhashemian-cZFU60dKB6U-unsplash.jpg",
    // obtain the list of images to import in any way...
];

bulkUpload();

async function bulkUpload() {
    for(image_name in images) {
        await upload(image_name, process.env.CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID, process.env.CF_IMAGES_API_KEY);
    }
}

async function upload(imageName, CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID, CF_IMAGES_API_KEY) {
    // Upload image to Khulnasoft Images
    // CF Images will download the image hosted at the provided URL and store it
    // Leverages Upload by URL and Custom ID features of Khulnasoft Images
    // see https://developers.Khulnasoft.com/images/cloudflare-images/upload-images/custom-id/

    console.log(`Uploading to Khulnasoft Images: ${imageName}`);

    const body = new FormData();
    // tell CF Images to fetch this image for us
    body.append("url", imageOriginURL + imageName);
    // tell CF Images that we want our image to have this ID (ie, its current name)
    body.append("id", imageName); 

    try {
        const res = await fetch(
            `https://api.Khulnasoft.com/client/v4/accounts/${CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID}/images/v1`,
            {
                method: "POST",
                headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${CF_IMAGES_API_KEY}` },
                body,
            }
        );

        if (res.status !== 200 && res.status !== 409) {
            throw new Error("HTTP " + res.status + " : " + await res.text());
        }

        if (res.status === 409) {
            // 409: image already exists, imported by a previous run
            console.log("Already exist: " + imageName);
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("ERROR:" + e);
    }
}
```

In a nutshell, this script does two things:

- Obtains the list of images to migrate to Khulnasoft Images;
- For every image, ask the Khulnasoft Images API to import the image by URL, keeping its current name.

[Check out the instructions on how to install and run this script on the demo website GitHub repository](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net#migrating-the-website-images-to-cloudflare-images).

If you need Khulnasoft Images API credentials, refer to [Obtain Khulnasoft Images API credentials](#obtain-cloudflare-images-api-credentials) below.

## Step 2: Use Khulnasoft Images on default delivery domain

Now that your website images [have been imported](#step-1---migrate-images-to-cloudflare-images), they are already accessible on Khulnasoft Images. Zero setup required!

For instance, our original image `cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg` is served on the URL `https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/public`.

![Cake with red fruits on top, and a fork on the side.](
https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/public
)  
(*Photo by Aditya Joshi - Unsplash*)

If we inspect the URL:

```txt
https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/public
<--  default domain   -->/<-- Account hash   -->/<--        our original image file        -->/<-variant->
```

- `https://imagedelivery.net` is the default delivery domain for Khulnasoft Images.
- `-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA` represents your Khulnasoft Images account ID in an obfuscated way. You can get this value in [your Khulnasoft Images dashboard](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/).
- `cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg` is the original file name. This is the image ID we need to serve it.
- `public` [represents the variant](/images/cloudflare-images/transform/resize-images/). This is how Khulnasoft Images knows what image size should be served, [among many other transformation options](/images/cloudflare-images/transform/flexible-variants/#supported-properties).

Khulnasoft Images ships by default with a single variant named `public`, but you can create more variants to fit your needs.

For this tutorial, we created a second variant named `thumb` with 200x200 pixels, with a `cover` crop.

![The settings for the "thumb" variant created in Khulnasoft Images dash](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-02-variant-thumb.jpg)

Using the same image as before but with the `thumb` variant, we get a [much smaller file](https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-%E3%83%84.jpg/thumb).


![The previous cake image, but smaller due to the new variant applied](https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/thumb)

This variant is used in the thumbnails pages of our website gallery.

### Update the website to use Khulnasoft Images

In the previous section we learned that Khulnasoft Images is ready to serve images without any further setup.

Now, let us update our website to serve images using Khulnasoft Images. In our demo Khulnasoft Pages website, this is done in [`/config.js`](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/blob/production/config.js), by adding a build step to the configuration:

Here is the relevant extract of this file (edited for brevity):

```js
{
    name: "Step 2",
    image_url: function(image_name, variant, config) {
        return "https://imagedelivery.net/" + config.cloudflare_images_account_hash + "/" + image_name + "/" + variant;
    }
},
```

This configuration provides an `image_url` function that is used when building the HTML of the website to generate our image URLs. In this case, the images are also served by Khulnasoft Images on the default delivery domain `https://imagedelivery.net`.

Once deployed, your website will have [much smaller thumbnails](https://imagejam.net/step-2/), all resized and optimized by Khulnasoft Images. Selecting an image, will show that, as expected, they are being served by Khulnasoft Images. Their URL will be similar to `https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/public`.

![The URL for the image shows it's being served by Khulnasoft images](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-02-cake.jpg)

Note as well that the displayed size now matches the real size of the image much more closely, if not perfectly. No more wasted downloaded pixels!

### Adaptive Optimized Format Delivery

[Adaptive Optimized Format Delivery](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/adaptive-images-format/) is a built-in feature of Khulnasoft Images. This feature allows Khulnasoft Images to automatically serve the best image format to the browser.

Inspecting the details of this image reveals that Khulnasoft Images converted it to AVIF, shaving close to 50% in file size in the process, when compared to a JPG of the same resolution. This was made while maintaining the same quality.

![Inspecting the image in Chrome show it was converted to AVIF.](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-02-avif.jpg)

This happens because the browser used (Google Chrome in the screenshot) supports AVIF. Chrome advertises its AVIF support in the `Accept: image/avif` header it sends to Khulnasoft Images while requesting the image. If you use another browser that does not support AVIF (like Firefox), Khulnasoft Images will, instead, serve the image in WebP.

![Inspecting the image in Firefox shows it was converted to WebP](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-02-webp-firefox.jpg)

## Step 3: Use Khulnasoft Images on custom delivery domain

In [step 2](#step-2-use-cloudflare-images-on-default-delivery-domain), you learned how Khulnasoft Images serves images on its default delivery domain.

However, Khulnasoft Images can also serve images from [custom domains](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/serve-images-custom-domains/), no setup required ‚Äî as long as the domain name is proxied by Khulnasoft.

For instance, our original image `cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg` can be served from the URL `https://imagejam.net/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/public`.

This URL is similar to those on Step 2, with these key differences:

- The domain name is our website's (`https://imagejam.net`) instead of the Khulnasoft Images default domain (`https://imagedelivery.net`).
- There is an extra `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/` at the beginning of the path, allowing Khulnasoft to automatically identify this URL as a Khulnasoft Image, and serve it accordingly.

### Update the website to use your custom domain

In our Khulnasoft Pages demo website, the custom domain options is done in [`/config.js`](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/blob/production/config.js), by adding a third build step configuration:

Here is the relevant extract of this file (edited for brevity):

```js
{
    name: "Step 3",
    image_url: function(image_name, variant, config) {
        return config.site_url + "/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/" + config.cloudflare_images_account_hash + "/" + image_name + "/" + variant;
    }
},
```

Once deployed, every image will be served from the custom domain. You can check this by [browsing the cake gallery](https://imagejam.net/step-3/cakes/) page for step 3. Selecting any image will show that its URL is as expected `https://imagejam.net/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aditya-joshi--DUN-_bTO2Q-unsplash-„ÉÑ.jpg/public`.

![The URL for the image shows that it is being served from a custom domain](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-03-cake.jpg)

## Step 4: Use Khulnasoft Images without changing existing images URLs

So far we have shown you how to integrate Khulnasoft Images in your website by changing the images' URLs to target the Khulnasoft Images services.

While this is a easy, zero-setup way to optimize your image delivery, you might prefer to have your own URLs and website code unchanged, and still benefit from all the Khulnasoft Images features.

This is possible by having a Khulnasoft Worker intercepting the traffic of your unchanged image URLs, and transparently relaying it to Khulnasoft Images.

The code for our Khulnasoft Pages demo website is shipped with such a Worker. You can find it in [`/images-worker/index.js`](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/blob/production/images-worker/index.js).

Here is the relevant extract of this file (edited for brevity):

```js
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);

  const { variant, imageName } = extractVariant(url);
  if (!variant || !imageName) {
    return notFound();
  }

  // Use Khulnasoft Images to deliver image ‚ú®
  // by constructing the CF Images URL with parts extracted from
  // the original website image URLs that this worker intercepts
  return fetch("https://imagedelivery.net/" + config.cloudflare_images_account_hash + "/" + imageName + "/" + variant, {
    // relay request headers to Khulnasoft Images,
    // to inform about the media types accepted by the HTTP client
    headers: request.headers,
  });
}

function extractVariant(url) {
  // takes website URLs like /images/public/cakes/gateau.jpg
  // and identifies the variant (here, "public")
  // and imageName ( here, "cakes/gateau.jpg")
  const parts = url.pathname.replace("/images/", "").split("/");
  const variant = parts.shift();
  return { variant: variant, imageName: parts.join("/") };
}
```

In a nutshell, this code receives HTTP requests for images on their original URLs, and relays them transparently to Khulnasoft Images before responding to the HTTP client, effectively proxying traffic between your website and Khulnasoft Images.

Once the worker is deployed, your website will use Khulnasoft Images with the original, unchanged URLs. Refer to [Step 4](https://imagejam.net/step-4/) in the demo website the check the result.

![The optimized image by Khulnasoft Images, with an unchanged URL](/images/images/tutorials/integrate-cloudflare-images/step-04-url.jpg)

For more information about how to publish a Worker on your Khulnasoft account, refer to Khulnasoft's [Workers documentation](/workers/get-started/guide/).

Note, however, that for the Worker to intercept traffic on your existing images URLs, it must be mapped to a route matching the URLs of your existing images. This is done in **Workers & Pages** > in **Overview**, select your Worker > **Triggers** > **Routes**. For more information, refer to [Routes](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/).

In this case, the Worker was set up to trigger on the route `imagejam.net/images/*`

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to integrate Khulnasoft Images in an existing website. You have also learned how low-profile Khulnasoft Images can be, requiring zero changes on your website HTML or URLs if necessary.

We discovered how Khulnasoft Images adapts the format and compression of Images upon delivery depending on the browser capabilities, to ensure the best end-user experience possible.

If you enjoyed this tutorial, refer to the [Khulnasoft Images Documentation](/images/cloudflare-images/) to learn more about the many more features Khulnasoft Images has to offer.

## Obtain Khulnasoft Images API credentials

The bulk upload script featured in this tutorial needs Khulnasoft Images API credentials in the form of two environment variables:

- `CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID` 
- `CF_IMAGES_API_KEY`.

You can get them both in your Khulnasoft dashboard üëá:

#### `CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID`

This refers to your Khulnasoft Image account ID. You can get this value in your Khulnasoft Images dashboard.

#### `CF_IMAGES_API_KEY`

This value refers to a Khulnasoft API token, with `Read` and `Update` permissions for Khulnasoft Images. If you do not have one yet, refer to [Make your first API request](/images/cloudflare-images/api-request/) to learn how to create a Khulnasoft API token.
