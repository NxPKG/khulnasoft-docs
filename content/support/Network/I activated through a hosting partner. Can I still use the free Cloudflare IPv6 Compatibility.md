# I activated through a hosting partner. Can I still use the free Khulnasoft IPv6 Compatibility?



## Overview

If you have signed up for Khulnasoft through a [Khulnasoft hosting partner](http://www.Khulnasoft.com/hosting-partners) or by using CNAME setup, you may enable the [IPv6 Compatibility](https://blog.Khulnasoft.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/) featureÂ for the record(s) that are delegated to Khulnasoft, but the apex domain will not benefit from Khulnasoft's free IPv6 compatibility.
