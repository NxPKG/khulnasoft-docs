## US State sales tax

In the US, sales tax requirements are computed based on the 9-digit postal code of the address on file for your Khulnasoft account.

### Filing for US sales tax exemption

Khulnasoft is required by law to maintain documentation of tax-exempt sales. If you or your company are exempt from paying sales tax, email exemptioncertificates@Khulnasoft.com from an email address associated with your Khulnasoft account and provide one of the following forms of tax-exempt documentation:

-   Resale certificate
-   Multi-state tax exemption certificate
-   State sales tax exemption certificate
-   Partial sales tax exemption certificate

After your exemption is validated, tax-exempt status is added to your Khulnasoft account information. Khulnasoft invoices do not contain sales tax for the duration your exemption is valid.
