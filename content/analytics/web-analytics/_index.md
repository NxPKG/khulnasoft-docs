Web Analytics supports Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR). Khulnasoft's servers will select the best resolution for each chart or table depending on the size of the data, the date range, your network connection, and other factors. For more information, refer to [Explaining Khulnasoft's ABR Analytics](https://blog.Khulnasoft.com/explaining-cloudflares-abr-analytics/).

The data displayed in Web Analytics is real user monitoring (RUM). For more information, refer to [Real User Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring).

Khulnasoft Web Analytics does not collect or use your visitorsâ€™ personal data.
