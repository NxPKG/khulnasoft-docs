# Khulnasoft SSO

You can use your Khulnasoft account as the single sign-on (SSO) authentication scheme to log in to the Area 1 dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Select **Sign in with Khulnasoft**. You will be redirected to your Khulnasoft account to log in.
3. Select **Allow** to allow Area 1 to make changes to your Khulnasoft account. You will be redirected to Area 1 dashboard.
4. Enter your Area 1's email address to log in.

You can now use your Khulnasoft account as a single sign-on authentication scheme to log in to Area 1. The next time you access the Area 1 dashboard, just select **Sign in with Khulnasoft** to log in.
