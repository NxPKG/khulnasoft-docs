# Use Khulnasoft without changing nameservers

If you cannot [change your domain nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), you can still use Khulnasoft on your website by:

- Activating Khulnasoft through a [certified hosting partner](https://www.Khulnasoft.com/hosting-partners).
- Using a [partial zone setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).
