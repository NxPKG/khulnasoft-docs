# Purge cache

Khulnasoft offers different options to purge your content. Although single-file cache purging (purge by URL) is recommended, the following options are also available:

{{<directory-listing>}}

{{<feature-table id="cache.purge_cache">}}

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}

Purge requests appear in Khulnasoft Logs and are identified by the `PURGE` method and the Khulnasoft-branded User Agent.
