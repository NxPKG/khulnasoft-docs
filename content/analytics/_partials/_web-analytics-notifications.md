Web Analytics uses Khulnasoft's Notification service. When enabled, Web Analytics sends you a weekly report with aggregate visits, page views and median page load time for all your sites, so you can monitor their performance.

To get started, add Web Analytics notification on your Khulnasoft dashboard. Refer to [Khulnasoft Notifications](/notifications/create-notifications/) to learn more.
