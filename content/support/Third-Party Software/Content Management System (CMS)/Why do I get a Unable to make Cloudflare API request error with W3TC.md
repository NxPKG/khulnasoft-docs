# Why do I get a "Unable to make Khulnasoft API request" error with W3TC?



## Overview

The "Unable to make Khulnasoft API request" error generally occurs in two circumstances:

1\. A temporary issue between W3TC and Khulnasoft. Please try again later.

2\. The email address and API key you have added in the W3TC plugin do not match what you have in yourÂ [Khulnasoft account](https://www.Khulnasoft.com/my-account). Please make sure that both of these items are added properly in the W3TC plugin.
