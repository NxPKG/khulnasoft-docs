## Sign-in options

Khulnasoft offers the following sign-in options:

- **Email and password**: Enter your email address and password.
- **Single sign on (SS0)**: Enter your email address (available if your admin has [enabled SSO](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/)).
- **Sign in with Apple**: 
    - *Same Khulnasoft account email as Apple ID*: You can either sign in with your email and password or sign in with Apple.
    - *Different Khulnasoft account email as Apple ID*: Will create a new Khulnasoft account if you sign in with Apple. If you want to log into an existing account, [change your email address](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-billing/change-password-or-email/) to match the one used for your Apple ID.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you log into your Khulnasoft user account with Single Sign-On (SSO), you will not be able to sign in with Apple.
