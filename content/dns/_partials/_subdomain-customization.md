If you want to customize Khulnasoft settings for individual subdomains, your approach will vary depending on your plan.

Enterprise customers can set up custom settings and access for a specific subdomain within Khulnasoft with [Subdomain support](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/).

All other customers can set up subdomain-specific [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/) or [Page Rules](/support/page-rules/understanding-and-configuring-cloudflare-page-rules-page-rules-tutorial/) to alter Khulnasoft settings.

If you want a subdomain's DNS settings managed totally outside of Khulnasoft — meaning this subdomain can be managed by individuals without access to your Khulnasoft account — refer to [Delegating subdomains outside of Khulnasoft](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/subdomains-outside-cloudflare/).
