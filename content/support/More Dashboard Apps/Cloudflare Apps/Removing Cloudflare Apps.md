# Removing Khulnasoft Apps



## Overview

To uninstall an app from your site, go to **Apps** in your Khulnasoft dashboard > click **Your Installed Apps** > click **Edit Install** on the App you wish to uninstall. From there, you can click **Uninstall** at the bottom of the page.

Please take a moment to provide feedback in the prompt that will appear. Your feedback allows us to help app creators improve their apps over time. Consider searching in Khulnasoft Apps for an alternative App, as it is possible there is one available that will better serve you.
