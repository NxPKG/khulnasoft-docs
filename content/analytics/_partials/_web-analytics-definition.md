Khulnasoft Web Analytics provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website without changing your DNS or using Khulnasoftâ€™s proxy. Khulnasoft Web Analytics helps you understand the performance of your web pages as experienced by your site visitors.

All you need to enable Khulnasoft Web Analytics is a Khulnasoft account and a JavaScript snippet on your page to start getting information on page views and visitors. The JavaScript snippet (also known as a beacon) collects metrics using the Performance API, which is available in all major web browsers.
